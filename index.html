        <h1>PrismOS Information</h1>
        <p class="Info2">Prism OS is a small project maintained by four developers. It is intended to become a widely used OS with the motivation behind this project being the fact most current operating system are slow, and based off the old existing kernels. Windows for example, has not had a complete kernel rewrite in 20+ years. This project is based off the Cosmos developer kit, which uses C# as its internal coding language.</p>
